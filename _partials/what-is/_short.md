# About the AWS EC2 Mac AMI Scan

The Veertu AWS EC2 Mac AMI Scan software solution scans for vulnerabilities in your Mac AMIs using an NVD database. The scanner identifies vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies, packages, and libraries, including Brew, Golang, Javascript, Java, Ruby, Python, Rust, etc.

AWS EC2 Mac AMI Scan software can be [installed on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance](#getting-started). AWS EC2 Mac AMI Scan detects vulnerabilities in the Mac AMIs without the need to start instances. It will instead mount the EC2 Mac AMI snapshot as a volume.
